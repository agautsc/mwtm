			<p>For years I have prepared for this day. I remember this first time I heard Meg and Evan were splitting car insurance. We were sitting at The Handlebar, at the table right next to the bar and side window, eating fries and drinking Trifecta. To them, the fact of shared insurance came out nonchalantly — like Evan mentioning a new sickness. For me, it seemed a sign of a legal, lifetime bond. I dunked my fingers in ice water, flicked drops of water on the couple, made the sign of the cross, and proclaimed them married.</p>
<p>Right after the Mevans&#8217; first &#8220;marriage&#8221; I started to think of the story I&#8217;d tell at their official wedding: when, in college, Evan first mentioned Meg to me; the beginning of Mevan 2.0; and, of course, Evan&#8217;s famous trip to Monterrey&#8217;s were all on the list. These are all good stories, but nothing better explains the Mevans&#8217; importance in all our lives than the meals we shared with them.</p>
<p>Besides immediate family, there is no doubt that I&#8217;ve shared more meals with the Mevans than anyone. They&#8217;re a good mix.</p>
<p>Meg is the starter. The invite to a meal or a party is most often from her. She comes loaded with researched recipes and ready to rock. All the contributors in this cookbook are close friends because of her. Meg&#8217;s desire to host bourbon tastings, kale cook-offs and front yard bonfires brought us all closer.</p>
<p>Evan is a lily-gilding culinary crazy man. He happily reads all the directions and then promptly disregards them. Evan often needs a kick in the pants to get started, but once folks are at his place, there is nothing he won&#8217;t do to make them happy and well fed. He literally turns into a grandmother demanding folks to &#8220;eat — eat, honey&#8221; and making sure no one&#8217;s glass gets below the halfway point.</p>
<p>Meg often goes to bed before the party ends while Evan stays up until the bitter end.</p>
<p>They are a good mix indeed. The Mevans love friends and sharing food with them. What better way to pay tribute to the couple than to collect some of the best recipes and stories from some of their best friends?</p>

	<li class="cat-item cat-item-26"><a href="http://mealswiththemevans.com/blog/category/bbq/" title="I remember the first time I shared a meal with Meg. Since we knew Chip we knew of Cashiers Carolina Smokehouse (1). During summers in Clemson we’d drive up the Blue Ridge Mountains in Jimmy’s VW or in a small caravan of cars to Cashiers. Because Cashiers was in a dry county, we would travel with a cooler or two full of beers. We’d sip on one or two while riding up the winding mountain roads trying not to spill a sip and failing regularly. Once we arrived at Cashiers, we’d sit outside on the license plate-lined porch, drink cooler beer (2), listen to bluegrass, and eat the best chopped pork and tomato-based barbecue sauce there was. This is where Meg broke the news to me that she didn’t eat red meat and therefore wouldn’t be eating the pork. I did not take the news well. I’m sure I used the “other white meat” line, and I’m sure she responded with science. So started a dynamic that lasts to this day — me making arguments based on, what I believe to be, clever lines and Meg demanding scientific rigor. Good for her. Footnotes &amp; Various Sundries1. We just called it Cashiers and, in fact, it took me years to know this place had a proper name2. Cashiers was BYOB because of the whole dry county thing. This was as close to our bootlegging roots as any of us would get. Well, there is the time Walker talked to the cows, but that’s for a different cookbook. 3.  I do sleep better at night knowing Meg has had pulled pork and BBQ ribs since this time. I’m not sure she’s ever had Cashiers. I hope so. ">BBQ</a>

	<li class="cat-item cat-item-31"><a href="http://mealswiththemevans.com/blog/category/beer/" title="We were watching a Clemson game at Mevan&#039;s house. We did that often. Meg was running some errands before the game started and it was taking her longer than expected to get back. Evan, worried about Meg, started to pace the house and lifting the blinds of different windows and yelling, &quot;where is Meg!&quot;. Paivi started to cry laugh and astutely exclaimed, &quot;You&#039;re just like Sarko not able to sit until Meg gets home.&quot; It&#039;s true. Evan was smitten and was never comfortable until Meg arrived home.Later that day Paivi and Meg finished most of Evan&#039;s brewed beer that was kegged and staying cold in the sink. Evan never kegged beer again. Bottles only in his home brew experiments. ">Beer</a>
</li>
	<li class="cat-item cat-item-27"><a href="http://mealswiththemevans.com/blog/category/chili/" title="When Meg moved to Knoxville she left Evan behind to get the house ready to sell. This meant mostly handcrafting a front door and making chili. He&#039;d make a batch of chili on Sunday and eat on the pot all week long. His signature chili was a sweet potato chili. We don&#039;t have the recipes, but this a good batch of recipes all the same.">Chili/Soup</a>

	<li class="cat-item cat-item-29"><a href="http://mealswiththemevans.com/blog/category/dessert/" title="For years, Eliza hosted pie parties. We started attending towards the end of the run, but I still like to think we left our mark. During Evan&#039;s gluten-free phase he made a &quot;Frogmore Stew&quot; pie that won multiple awards. The construction of this pie cemented Evan&#039;s reputation for gilding the lily(1) as he layered ingredient after ingredient on the pie. After each new layer was added he&#039;d ask &quot;What if I added ...&quot; until the entire kitchen begged him to stop.Meg made a macaroni and cheese pie two years in a row that became a staple of our non-pie party diet as well. Almost certainly the most famous of the pies we made was the &quot;Occupied&quot; an amazing team effort that included three different pies wrapped in cake, frosted and decorated with doughnut holes and pie puns galore. My favorite pun to this day is &quot;Bake-offs not Bail-outs,&quot; but feel free to view the whole lot of them.Notes &amp; Sundries 1. This also led me to buy GildingThePiggy.com, a domain, to this day, I believe would be a great BBQ-focused food blog. So would &quot;The Butcher, The Baker, and the Barbeque Maker&quot; and &quot;Crispy Bits.&quot; (Back)">Dessert</a>

On one random Tuesday we were trying to think of a clever reason to cook together and Mad said, in a joking but true tone, &quot;man, we&#039;ll do anything not to eat alone.&quot; We laughed and agreed and continued to brainstorm ideas.

	<li class="cat-item cat-item-30"><a href="http://mealswiththemevans.com/blog/category/camping/" title="We used to play poker weekly. It started simply enough. Walker invited folks over for a friendly game. This is where Tucker first came into our life. He&#039;d arrive with four cans of Guinness and a wallet full of cash. He&#039;d leave with both cans and wallet empty. (1) Over time, we got more serious and formed the BetMax Poker League (Bing, Bing). We played weekly games all over the Upstate — Six Mile, a vacant church ... other places. But the best location was always the RV tailgating spots for Clemson football. These were the salad days of tailgating. You could sneak four or so cars into a single tailgate. Each car came loaded with beer, food and people. We&#039;d play late into the night forced to stay awake by Chip&#039;s love for Follow the Queen Tear it Down.  No man can sleep through Chip&#039;s cackle when no queen shows.Thanks to these tailgates we experienced Chip&#039;s shrimp and grits (and Walker&#039;s warning of stepping out of the trailer) and discovered Natalia&#039;s true love for Cheetos.  Poker and the BetMax League became pretty important. We had a weight loss competition that Walker almost died to win and an Olympics that Derek won with too much ease. Our finals were a fine celebration made consisting of rare steak, cheap beer and good card play. After Wes was crowned champ we continued to play, but slightly less often. Of course, there was the time Evan missed a game because he was at Monterrey&#039;s. Footnotes &amp; Various Sundries (1) Years later Tucker claimed he was doing that all on purpose. He was losing to learn how we play so he could get us later. He did win the BetMax tournament so who am I to argue? Well, me, I might argue a little bit. ">Tailgating/Camping</a>
